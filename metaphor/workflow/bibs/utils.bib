Biopython includes modules for reading and writing different sequence file formats and multiple sequence alignments, dealing with 3D macro molecular structures, interacting with common tools such as BLAST, ClustalW and EMBOSS, accessing key online databases, as well as providing numerical methods for statistical learning. © The Author 2009.

	url = {https://zenodo.org/record/3767070},
	abstract = {This is minor release with bug fixes for issues identified since 0.10.0. Fixed a bug that appeared within the bootstrapping algorithm on 32-bit systems. Fixed a bug where regplot would crash on singleton inputs. Now a crash is avoided and regression estimation/plotting is skipped. Fixed a bug where heatmap would ignore user-specified under/over/bad values when recentering a colormap. Fixed a bug where heatmap would use values from masked cells when computing default colormap limits. Fixed a bug where despine would cause an error when trying to trim spines on a matplotlib categorical axis. Adapted to a change in matplotlib that caused problems with single swarm plots. Added the showfliers parameter to boxenplot to suppress plotting of outlier data points, matching the API of boxplot. Avoided seeing an error from statmodels when data with an IQR of 0 is passed to kdeplot. Added the legend.title\_fontsize to the plotting\_context definition. Deprecated several utility functions that are no longer used internally (percentiles, sig\_stars, pmf\_hist, and sort\_df).},
